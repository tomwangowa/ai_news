3.7 Sonnet does well on many coding benchmarks like SWE-Bench Verified and aider and Cognition's junior-dev eval, both with and without (MOSTLY uncensored!) thinking.

However the most popular new benchmark, covered in the second blogpost on extended thinking, is Pokebench which mirrors the Voyager paper as an agentic benchmark:

The feature set and documentation at launch is pretty impressive. Among the notable things likely to get buried by the headlines:

the new system prompt
redacted thinking encoding/decoding
streaming thinking
128k OUTPUT token capability (in beta)
context window and prompt caching skips previous turn thinking blocks) image.png
tool use
agreeing with Grok 3 that parallel test time compute is useful and worth studying
