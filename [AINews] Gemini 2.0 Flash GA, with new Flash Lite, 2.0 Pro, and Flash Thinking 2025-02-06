Gemini 2.0 has been "here" since December (our coverage here), but now we can officially count Gemini 2.0 Flash's prices as "real", and put them up on our Pareto frontier chart:

We will grant that raw intelligence charts like those mean increasingly less and will probably die this year because they cannot accurately describe the multimodal input AND output capabilities of these releases, nor coding ability, nor the 1-2m long context, as Sundar Pichai demonstrates:

Of particular note is the cost effectiveness of the new "Flash Lite", as well as the very slight price hike that Gemini 2.0 Flash has vs 1.5 Flash.

Curiously enough, the competitive dynamics of OpenAI "mogging" Google releases seem to have stayed in 2024.
