We're regrettably late to covering this paper, but late is better than never. s1: Simple test-time scaling documents a new reasoning model with 2 novel contributions:

finetuned from Qwen 2.5 32B on just 1000 questions paired with reasoning traces distilled from Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, filtered for difficulty, diversity, and quality (26 mins of training on 16 H100s)
controllable test-time compute by either forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. image.png
Lead author Niklas Muennighoff, who notably worked on Bloom, StarCoder, MTEB, and contributed to BIG-bench, notes that this second trick reproduces the famous o1 scaling chart:

Theme 4. Over-Tokenized Transformer Enhances LLM Performance

Over-Tokenized Transformer - New paper shows massively increasing the input vocabulary (100x larger or more) of a dense LLM significantly enhances model performance for the same training cost (Score: 324, Comments: 37): A new paper demonstrates that massively increasing the input vocabulary of a dense Large Language Model (LLM) by 100 times or more significantly boosts model performance without increasing training costs. This finding suggests a potential strategy for improving transformer efficiency by expanding the vocabulary size.
Tokenization and Vocabulary Size: Increasing the vocabulary size to millions, as opposed to the typical 32k to 128k, can enhance model performance by using more meaningful, hierarchical tokens. This approach achieves faster convergence by combining multiple tokens into new ones, though it primarily improves training performance rather than final performance in direct proportion.
Potential Challenges and Considerations: Concerns arise about undertrained tokens due to greedy tokenizers, which might lead to performance issues with misspellings and tasks sensitive to single character mutations, such as arithmetic or algebraic reasoning. There are also questions regarding the impact on memory usage, inference speed, and effective context size when using smaller tokens.
Research and Comparisons: A similar study from three months ago suggested that models like Llama 2 70B should use at least 216k tokens for optimal compute use, and even larger token counts could be beneficial. The paper's findings are particularly interesting for dense models, but they did not show the same improvement for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, highlighting a potential area for further exploration.
