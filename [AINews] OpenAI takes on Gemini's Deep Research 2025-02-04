o3 and tools are all you need.

AI News for 1/31/2025-2/3/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, 433 Twitters and 34 Discords (225 channels, and 16942 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 1721 minutes. You can now tag @smol_ai for AINews discussions!

When introducing Operator (our coverage here), sama hinted at more OpenAI Agents soon on the way, but few of us were expecting the next one in 9 days, shipped from Japan on a US Sunday no less:

The blogpost offers more insight into intended usecases, but the bit notable is Deep Research's result on Dan Hendrycks' new HLE benchmark more than doubling the result of o3-mini-high released just on Friday (our coverage here).

They also released a SOTA result on GAIA - which was criticized by coauthors for just releasing public test set results - obviously problematic for an agent that can surf the web, though there is zero reason to question the integrity of this especially when confirmed in footnotes and as samples of the GAIA test traces were published.

OAIDR comes with its own version of the "inference time scaling" chart which is very impressive - not in the scaling of the chart itself, but in the clear rigor demonstrated in the research process that made producing such a chart possible (assuming, of course, that this is research, not marketing, but here the lines are unfortunately blurred to sell a $200/month subscription).

OpenAI staffers confirmed that this is the first time the full o3 has been released in the wild (and gdb says it is "an extremely simple agent"), and the blogpost notes that a "o3-deep-research-mini" version is on the way which will raise rate limits from the 100 queries/month available today.

Reception has been mostly positive, sometimes to the point of hyperventilation. Some folks are making fun of the hyperbole, but on balance we tend to agree with the positive takes of Ethan Mollick and Dan Shipper, though we do experience a lot of failures as well.

Shameless Plug: We will have multiple Deep Research and other agent builders, including the original Gemini Deep Research team, at AI Engineer NYC on Feb 20-22. Last call for applicants!

Theme 1. Paradigm Shift in AI Model Hardware: From GPUs to CPU+RAM

Paradigm shift? (Score: 532, Comments: 159): The post suggests a potential paradigm shift in AI model processing from a GPU-centric approach to a CPU+RAM configuration, specifically highlighting the use of AMD EPYC processors and RAM modules. This shift is visually depicted through contrasting images of a man dismissing GPUs and approving a CPU+RAM setup, indicating a possible change in hardware preferences for AI computations.
CPU+RAM Viability: The shift towards AMD EPYC processors and large RAM configurations is seen as viable for individual users due to cost-effectiveness, but GPUs remain preferable for serving multiple users. The cost of building an EPYC system is significantly higher, with estimates ranging from $5k to $15k, and performance is generally slower compared to GPU setups.
Performance and Configuration: There is a focus on optimizing configurations, such as using dual socket 12 channel systems and ensuring all memory slots are filled for optimal performance. Some users report achieving 5.4 tokens/second with specific models, while others suggest that I/O bottlenecks and not utilizing all cores can affect performance.
Potential Breakthroughs and MoE Models: Discussions include the potential for breakthroughs in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which could allow for reading LLM weights directly from fast NVMe storage, thus reducing active parameters. This could change the current hardware requirements, but the feasibility and timing of such advancements remain uncertain.
Theme 2. Rise of Mistral, Qwen, and DeepSeek outside the USA

Mistral, Qwen, Deepseek (Score: 334, Comments: 114): Non-US companies such as Mistral AI, Qwen, and DeepSeek are releasing open-source models that are more accessible and smaller in size compared to their US counterparts. This highlights a trend where international firms are leading in making AI technology more available to the public.
The Mistral 3 small 24B model is receiving positive feedback, with several users highlighting its effectiveness and accessibility. Qwen is noted for its variety of model sizes, offering more flexibility and usability on different hardware compared to Meta's Llama models, which are criticized for limited size options and proprietary licensing.
Discussions around US vs. international AI models reveal skepticism about the US's current offerings, with some users preferring international models like those from China due to their open-source nature and competitive performance. Meta is mentioned as having initiated the open weights trend, but users express concerns about the company's reliance on large models and proprietary licenses.
There is a debate about the strategic interests of companies in keeping AI model weights open or closed. Some argue that leading companies keep weights closed to maintain a competitive edge, while challengers release open weights to undermine these leaders. Meta's Llama 4 is anticipated to incorporate innovations from DeepSeek R1 to stay competitive.
Theme 3. Phi 4 Model Gaining Traction for Underserved Hardware

Phi 4 is so underrated (Score: 207, Comments: 84): The author praises the Phi 4 model (Q8, Unsloth variant) for its performance on limited hardware like the M4 Mac mini (24 GB RAM), finding it comparable to GPT 3.5 for tasks such as general knowledge questions and coding prompts. They express satisfaction with its capabilities without concern for formal benchmarks, emphasizing personal experience over technical metrics.
Phi 4's Strengths and Limitations: Users praise Phi 4 for its strong performance in specific areas, such as knowledge base and rule-following, even outperforming larger models in instruction adherence. However, it struggles with smaller languages, producing poor output outside of English, and lacks a 128k context version which limits its potential compared to Phi-3.
User Experiences and Implementations: Many users share positive experiences using Phi 4 in various workflows, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in tasks like prompt enhancement and creative benchmarks like cocktail creation. Some users, however, report poor results in specific tasks like ticket categorization, where other models like Llama 3.3 and Gemma2 perform better.
Tools and Workflow Integration: Discussions include using Phi 4 in custom setups, like Roland and WilmerAI, to enhance problem-solving by combining it with other models like Mistral Small 3 and Qwen2.5 Instruct.

Theme 4. DeepSeek-R1's Competence in Complex Problem Solving

DeepSeek-R1 never ever relaxes... (Score: 133, Comments: 30): The DeepSeek-R1 model showcased self-correction abilities by solving a math problem involving palindromic numbers, initially making a mistake but then correcting itself before completing its response. Notably, OpenAI o1 was the only other model to solve the problem, while several other models, including chatgpt-4o-latest-20241120 and claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, failed, raising questions about potential issues with tokenizers, sampling parameters, or the inherent mathematical capabilities of non-thinking LLMs.
Discussions highlight the self-correcting capabilities of LLMs, particularly in zero-shot settings. This ability stems from the model's exposure to training data where errors are corrected, such as on platforms like Stack Overflow, influencing subsequent token predictions to correct mistakes.
DeepSeek-R1 and other models like Mistral Large 2.1 and Gemini Thinking on AI Studio successfully solve the palindromic number problem, while the concept of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models is explored. CoT models are contrasted with non-CoT models, which typically struggle to correct errors mid-response due to different training paradigms.
The conversation delves into the foundational differences in training data across generational models (e.g., gen1, gen1.5, gen2) and the implications of these differences on error correction capabilities. There is a suggestion that presenting model outputs as user inputs for validation might help address these challenges.
