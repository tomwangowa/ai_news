It is a rare day when one frontier lab makes its debut, much less two (loosely speaking). But that is almost certainly what happened today.

We would say that the full Grok 3 launch stream is worth watching at 2x:

Opinions on Grok 3 are mixed, with lmarena, karpathy, and information recycler threadbois mostly very positive, whereas /r/OpenAI and other independent evals being more skeptical. Not everything is released either; Grok 3 isn't available in API and as of time of writing, the demoed "Think" and "Big Brain" modes aren't live yet. On the whole the evidence points to Grok 3 laying credible claim to being somewhere between o1 and o3, and this undeniable trajectory is why we award it title story.

There is less "news you can use" in the second item, but Mira Murati's post OpenAI plan is now finally public, and she has assembled what is almost certainly going to be a serious frontier lab in Thinking Machines, recruiting notables from across the frontier labs and specifically ChatGPT alumni:

There's not a lot of detail in the manifesto beyond a belief in publishing research, emphasis on collaborative and personalizable AI, multimodality, research and product co-design, and an empirical approach to safety and alignment. On paper, it looks like "Anthropic Redux".
